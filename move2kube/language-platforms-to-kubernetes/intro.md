In this scenario, you will learn how to use Konveyor Move2kube's two-step process to containerize and create deployment artifacts for your VM applications.

The *language-platforms* sample that we are going to use in this scenario is a combination of multiple applications in different languages (like Java, Go, Ruby, PHP and Node.js) which need to be containerized and then put into Kubernetes.

Move2Kube is a tool which can speed up the journey from traditional platforms like Cloud Foundry, Docker Compose and VM apps to Kubernetes. More details can be found at [move2kube.konveyor.io](https://move2kube.konveyor.io)
