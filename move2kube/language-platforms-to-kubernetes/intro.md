In this scenario, you will learn how to use Konveyor Move2Kube's two-step process to containerize and create deployment artifacts for a Polyglot Application. This could be an application deployed to a virtual machine (VM).

The *language-platforms* sample that we are going to use in this scenario is a polyglot application with multiple components written in different languages (like Java, Go, Ruby, PHP and Node.js). This polyglot application needs to be containerized and then deployed into Kubernetes.

Move2Kube is a tool which can speed up the journey from traditional platforms like Cloud Foundry, Docker Compose and Polyglot Application to Kubernetes. More details can be found at [move2kube.konveyor.io](https://move2kube.konveyor.io)
